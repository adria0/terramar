Terramar is a small [musical theraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_therapy) device for elderly people to help them to recall memories using songs. It uses raspberry a [raspberry](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) and python. It's a joint effort with [Ateneu de fabricaci√≥ de les corts](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/lescorts/ca/coneixeu-el-districte/lateneu-de-fabricacio-digital).


## Functionality

The device has a very basic functionality:

- Plays a sound saying that you have to guess which song from two are earlier in time
- Plays a first song (choosen from the `mp3` folder)
- Plays a second song (choosen from the `mp3` folder)
- Waits user to press one of the buttons
- The device emits a sound depending if the response is ok or not

you can see the logic in the [terramar.py](https://github.com/adria0/terramar/blob/main/terramar/terramar.py) file.
